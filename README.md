Move away from "Rails Way" and add object oriented design to your app.<br/>
This is a collection of resources that will help to build a maintainable apps.

## Intro
Organize your application by [domains](https://goo.gl/E1rl45).<br/>
Don't put all of your app code in [layers](https://goo.gl/8rWtzA).<br/>
Why? This makes your design low-cohesive instead of high-cohesive.<br/>
Don't confuse with the concept of loose-coupling (this is not the same).<br/>

Let's discuss what each concept means:
- highly cohesive - elements of a module are strongly related to each other;
- loosely coupled - modules minimize their deps so that they are easily modifiable;

Don't limit yourself by your framework, read more about: DDD, PORO, CQRS, GRASP, SOLID.
